This is a tutorial for writing reports with the R package `papaja`.

![](images/paste-E2FDEDC3.png){width="100"}

But why write in R in the first place? Why use `papaja`?

Advantages:

-   Formatting looks beautiful without much effort needed.

-   Conform to APA style (6th version). `papaja` is short for Preparing APA Journal Articles.

-   No need to go back and forth between R and Word to update figures and results.

-   Results are more reproducible with all data and analysis codes available in the document.

Disadvantages:

-   Learning curve is steeper at the start.

-   Need latex knowledge if you want to achieve something more complicated.

-   No grammar checker (Grammarly I'm looking at you), spelling corrector is not great.

-   With Github, collaboration and change tracking are possible. But, I haven't found a nice way to share and receive feedback.

Hope this gives you some motivation to learn `papaja`! Below are the learning objectives for this tutorial:

1\. Install the package, and apply the template.

2\. Know what YAML is, and apply basic changes.

3\. Create in-text citations and bibliography with the help of Zotero/.bib file.

4\. Understand how to reference variable values in text, insert pictures, and prepare APA-style figures.

```{r}
x <- "`r x`"
```

Write `` `r x` `` to print the value of x without actually writing down the number.

# Before start

To follow this tutorial, you'll need:

-   R and R Studio, for sure. I recommend updating R Studio to a version greater than v1.4, as the visual markdown editor is very useful.

-   R Markdown

-   Some basic knowledge of the R Studio interface

# Set-up

Let's start by creating a new project and installing the required packages.

## Create project

Create a new project: File --\> New Project --\> New Directory --\> New Project.

Let's name this project \`papaja_tutorial\`, and put it in a place you know of.

## Install tinytex

To knit markdown files into PDFs, you'll need the `tinytex` package. Install `tinytex` by running the following line in the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("tinytex")
```

Troubleshooting: if you see the error message "/usr/local/bin not writable" like I did, run these lines **in the terminal**, **not in R console** ([reference](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/24)):

```{r eval = FALSE}
[ -e /usr/local/bin ] || sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin
~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/*/tlmgr path add
```

Alternatively, you may also consider MikTeX for Windows, MacTeX for Mac, or TeX Live for Linux. See the [papaja manual](http://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/introduction.html#getting-started) for details.

## Install papaja

Run these lines to install `papaja`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja")
```
